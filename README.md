# Oil-Spill-classification
The Oil Spill Classification project aims to identify and classify oil spill events based on satellite images, environmental data, and other relevant features using machine learning algorithms
The primary goal of this project is to accurately classify oil spill events to aid in environmental monitoring and disaster management. 
By analyzing satellite imagery and environmental data, the model will differentiate between oil spill events and non-oil spill areas
